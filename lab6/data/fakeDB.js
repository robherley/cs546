		biography:
			"My name's Rob Herley. I'm a 3/4 CS Major at Stevens, with a minor in Science, Technology & Society. Simply put, I love all sorts of programming, especially robotics & web development. Currently I'm a CA for the undergrad web development class (CS-146), and I also work part-time as a software developer for IBM. \nIn terms of the future, I plan on becoming a full-stack developer, which nowadays can actually be a multitude of different positions, but I do lean more on the front-end side, it's a good creative outlet. Oh, and cloud computing is also pretty cool, too.",

		story:
			'An engineer who was unemployed for a long time decided to open a medical clinic. He puts a sign outside the clinic: "A cure for your ailment guaranteed at $500; we\'ll pay you $1,000 if we fail." A Doctor thinks this is a good opportunity to earn $1,000 and goes to his clinic. Doctor: "I have lost my sense of taste." Engineer: "Nurse, please bring the medicine from box 22 and put 3 drops in the patient\'s mouth." Doctor: "This is Gasoline!" Engineer: "Congratulations! You\'ve got your taste back. That will be $500." The Doctor gets annoyed and goes back after a couple of days later to recover his money. Doctor: "I have lost my memory, I cannot remember anything." Engineer: "Nurse, please bring the medicine from box 22 and put 3 drops in the patient\'s mouth." Doctor: "But that is Gasoline!" Engineer: "Congratulations! You\'ve got your memory back. That will be $500." The Doctor leaves angrily and comes back after several days, more determined than ever to make his money back. Doctor: "My eyesight has become weak." Engineer: "Well, I don\'t have any medicine for this. Take this $1,000," passing the doctor a $500 note. Doctor: "But this is $500..." Engineer: "Congratulations! You\'ve got your vision back! That will be $500."'
